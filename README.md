# Omu-transcriptome

Here are additional files for the article "Transcriptomic sequence dataset of a potential new model species for studying biomineralization Onchidoris muricata (Nudibranchia, Gastropoda, Mollusca)" by E. Nikitenko et al:
- de novo assembly of the Onchidoris muricata transcriptome after cd-hit-est with a threshold of 0.95 and after decontamination with MCSC - in file "assembly.0.95_decont.fasta.gz",
- matrix of TMM-normalized transcript counts for three size groups in three repetitions, obtained by mapping reads per assembly using bowtie2 - in file "RSEM.isoform.TMM.EXPR.matrix".
